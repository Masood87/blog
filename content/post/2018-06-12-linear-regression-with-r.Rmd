# linear regression

A simple linear regression using **mtcars** dataset, which is available with R. Here, we look at how number of cylinders in a car is associated with how many miles a car travels per gallon of gasoline--an indicator of fuel economy. Let's look at the structure of **mtcars** first.

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

**mpg** and **cyl** are my variables of interest. Let's run a linear regression and see the result.

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
```

As expected, the relationship is negative, meaning more cylinders is associated with lower miles per gallon (mpg). The `lm()` function can be wrapped inside `summary()` and `broom::tidy()` too.

```{r}
lm_model <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
broom::tidy(lm_model)
```
