_**Masood Sadat**_

I am trained in economics but my interest transcends economics to all social sciences, technology and data science. In addition to my formal education, which I owe a lot of my knowledge to, I have been self-learning and teaching others topics in data analysis and data science since 2014. I start this website/blog to share my work such as custom analysis, tips and tricks, and other related posts for public and for my future self.

I also maintain [**Afghanistan Data Hub**](http://afghanistandatahub.com). I created Afghanistan Data Hub to upload data sets on Afghanistan. In the next year or so, I plan to move it to my personal website in the near future though.
