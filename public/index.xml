      <description>About the Survey of the Afghan People Since 2006, The Asia Foundation conducts the Survey of the Afghan People, a nationally-representative annual survey. The Survey reflects perceptions about a broad range of topics including security, development, governance, service delivery, women’s rights, and migration.

      <description>In this post, we will explore visdat package to visualize missing values. Then, we will recreate a similar plot using ggplot2 package. Next, using the ggplot2 method, we will visualize other numeric or character values in a dataset. Finally, using the ggplot2 method, we will create a custom function that will plot any value in any dataset.
 There are many ways to inspect and find about missing values in a dataset.</description>

      <description>My name is Masood Sadat, from Afghanistan living in Kabul. I am trained in economics but my interest transcends economics to all social sciences, technology and data science. In addition to my formal education, which I owe a lot of my knowledge to, I have been self-learning and teaching others topics in data analysis and data science since 2014. I start this website/blog to share custom analysis I carry out every now and then, R and Stata tips and tricks, and other related posts for anyone interested and for my future self.</description>
