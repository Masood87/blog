      <description>A Meaningful Relationship The relatinship between weight (wt) and mileage (mpg) is negative one.
# library(ggplot2) ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;lm&amp;quot;, se = FALSE) Fit a linear model to estimate the linear relationship between weight and mpg. The relationship is negative and it is statistically significant.
# library(broom) # library(dplyr) tidy(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)) ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## 1 (Intercept) 37.285126 1.</description>

      <description>Estimating linear regression Before starting, I am going to load a number of utility libraries for this session.
library(tidyverse) library(broom) library(plotly) A simple linear regression using mtcars dataset. I want to look at how weight of a car is associated with how many miles a car travels per gallon of gasolineâ€“an indicator of fuel economy. I am going to look at their summary and scatter plot.</description>
