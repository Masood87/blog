      <description>About the Survey of the Afghan People Since 2006, The Asia Foundation conducts the Survey of the Afghan People, a nationally-representative annual survey. The Survey reflects perceptions about a broad range of topics including security, development, governance, service delivery, womenâ€™s rights, and migration. The Survey is broadly used by policy makers, academics, non-governmental organizations working in and on Afghanistan.
The data for all waves of the survey is publicly available on the Asia Foundation website.</description>
